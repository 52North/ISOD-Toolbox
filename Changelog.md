# ISOD-Toolbox

The ISOD Toolbox is an ILWIS 3.7 Open (or higher version) plug-in. It enables easy access to online data archives and supports their subsequent, efficient geospatial processing with ILWIS Open or other GI-Systems. When using this toolbox in conjunction with ILWIS 3.8, please use the appropriate EO Toolbox DLL.

# Releases

- [v1.5.0](https://github.com/52North/ISOD-Toolbox/releases/tag/v1.5.0)

## XML Configuration File

The configuration file contains the ISOD GUI menu structure. If you want to add new routines, this XML file can be adapted and modified using a text editor. The resulting menu will be adapted accordingly when a new instance of the ISOD Toolbox is started. This allows users with no programming experiences to adapt the toolbox according to their own preferences.
